# Zaraz Settings Configuration Guide

This guide shows you how to configure settings for your ABsmartly Custom Managed Component in Cloudflare Zaraz.

## ✅ Update: Pre-Configured Fields Now Available!

As of the latest deployment, the ABsmartly component now includes a `manifest.json` with pre-defined fields. When you add the tool in Zaraz, you should see the following fields automatically appear in the settings dropdown:

**Required Fields:**
- API Key
- Endpoint URL
- Environment
- Application Name

**Optional Fields:**
- Enable Debug Logging
- API Timeout (ms)
- Enable Anti-Flicker

If you see these fields in the dropdown, simply select them and enter your values. If they don't appear (older deployment), follow the manual instructions below.
